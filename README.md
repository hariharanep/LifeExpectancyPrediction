# LifeExpectancyPrediction
Small Project Where I Use Machine Learning Algorithms To Predict Life Expectancy

The dataset I used is located in the dataset folder.  
All the source code I used is located in the sources folder.  
All the instructions for how to generate the output in report.pdf and 
execute the code in the sources folder can be seen in manual.txt.
